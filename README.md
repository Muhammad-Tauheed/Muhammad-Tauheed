## Professional Summary

I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in MERN and PERN stacks, with a strong emphasis on backend architecture, API design, and secure, scalable systems. I currently work at Astra, contributing to production-grade KYC platforms and digital currency wallet applications.

My experience includes designing authentication flows, implementing role-based access control, optimizing database schemas, and building RESTful APIs using Node.js and NestJS. I work comfortably across the stack, but my core strength lies in backend engineering, system reliability, and maintainable codebases.

I actively focus on clean architecture, performance optimization, and security best practices while building applications intended for real-world usage and long-term scalability.
